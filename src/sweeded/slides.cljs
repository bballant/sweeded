*Kontor Forge connected us to our new favorite designer, James Coates. I gave him the Floorplans and a couple of mood boards, and he came back with some amazing ideas.*

-Shawn Stone, GM Robinson Concierge

*My boss tasked me, a lowly computer programmer, to fit five more interns into our small office and gave me a tiny budget (that bastard!). Luckily I was able to use Kontor Forge to manage the project. I got it done on time and on budget and my boss gave me the rest of the year off without pay! Win!*

-Ryan Valentine, Lowly Programmer, Penetrode, Inc.

*When we pivoted our compression network business to video chat, we had to scale up fast, but we didn't want to lose our identity. The designers from Kontor Forge helped guide the way and the collaboration tools allowed everyone to have their say. Our new office is fantastic, thanks to Kontor!*

-Erlich Bachman, Majority Investor, Pied Piper

*I wanted manage the expansion of Blue Book's AI division from my isolated Nordic retreat. Kontor Forge helped me run the project, find a great human designer, communicate with my team, and acquire all materials I needed right through their online dashboard, giving me more time to pump iron and drink beer. Amazing Kontor!*

-Nathan Bateman, CEO, Blue Book
